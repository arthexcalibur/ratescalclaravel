This is the RatesCalc laravel coding challenge.

Included in the package is a screenshot of the application in action.

There is only one main controller and route. The controller being app\Http\Controllers\HomeController.php.

All of the moving parts are within that file. The default Http facade from laravel was used to connect to the themoviedb API.

All of the requirements should have been met already by this application.
